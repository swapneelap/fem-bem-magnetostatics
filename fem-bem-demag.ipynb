    "From Maxwell's equations, the main PDE we get to solve for the demagnetisation field in the absence of an electric current is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta u = \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{M},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $u$ magnetosatic potential, and $\\vec{M}$ is the magnetisation. This equation holds over a domain $\\Omega$ where magnetisation is finite. The Poisson equation has an open boundary condition as $u$ decays to zero at infinity. Further, one can obtain the demagnetisation field from the magnetistatic potential as:\n",

    "This can be solved using standard FEM formulation, however, one needs to mesh region outside $\\Omega$ to apply the Dirichlet boundary condition $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} u(x) = 0$. To obtain $u$ over $\\Omega$ without meshing region with no magnetisation, a hybrid FEM-BEM technique is used as presented by [Fredkin & Koehler](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/106342?casa_token=DFfg4bkytawAAAAA:2VGK2UMtHkyFV8Oy8AgzQgkf2A5w1YDifH08BTpjo7A06EcFqN8cJC02Ku1r-KK4hAD0Ln7Nrw). The method essentially divides $u$ in two parts, $u_1$ and $u_2$, such that over the domain $\\Omega$:\n",
